# you can go look at the other files to refresh your memory
# you are also welcome to google questions. Avoid googling the answer, and try to google steps to the answer

# task 1: print out the sum of a and b.

a = 190
b = 51


# task 2: create two of your own variables, make them both integers. Multiply your two variables
# together








# task 3: create a variable for a string and an integer. print them both out in one statement
# bonus points: print them out with a space in between them, so it looks like: word 10. not word10






# task 4: create a string that has a number inside (e.g. "341") and convert it to an integer type.
# assign the new value to a new variable!



# task 5: given the two variable below, z and x, swap their values. so it looks like:
# z = "north"
# x = "america"

# do not directly edit their assignment statements.

z = "america"
x = "north"
