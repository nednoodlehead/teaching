# it is good practice to have a space between the hashtag and the beginning of the comment.

# variables
# assign a value to a variable using '='
my_variable = 10

# variables store values.


# printing
# you can print values out to the console (also known as stdout, standard output)
print(my_variable)

# printing can be useful for giving feedback to a user or asking them a question

# data types
# string. anything inside of "" or '' known as 'str'

my_string = "Hello, this is a string"
my_second_string = 'I can also be single quotes'


# integer. any number (negative, or positive), with no decimal point
my_number = -18
my_second_number = 1991


# float. any number (positive or negative), including a decimal point
my_float = 872.19
my_second_float = -191.10

# complex. an integer followed by the letter j, used in complex math stuffs

my_complex = 1j

# boolean. Either True or False
my_bool_1 = True
my_bool_2 = False


# null / None. Used to represent the absence of a value
my_null = None


# additional content

# anything inside of quotes is a string, no exceptions
i_am_a_string = "19"
i_am_also_a_string = "True"

# to follow general code styling rules, variable names should have no capital letters, and should use underscore '_' as a delimeter

# you can do simple math with complex, int, and float types
# print(3 + 10)
# print(13.11 - 6.55)
# print(-10 * 2)  # * = multiplication
# print(100 / 5) # / = division
# print(100 // 6) # 'floor' (division, but forget the remainder)
# print(103 % 25)  # the remainder of the division, 25 fits into 103 4 times, with 3 remaining, so the result is 3
# print(5 ** 9)  # 5 to the power or 9

# everything in python is caps sensitive, so `x = true` will throw an error, `x = True` is valid
